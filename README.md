# ML Introduction

This workshop aims to provide a brief introduction to machine learning by creating a model to recognize handwritten numbers.

## Setup

To use the provided Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), you need to set up Jupyter. The below instructions will set up Jupyter in VS Code.

1. Install Microsoft's Jupyter extension for VS Code.
2. Install the python package:

    `pip install jupyter`

## Resources

The following resources were used to create this workshop and are good for further exploration.

- [Handwritten Digit Recognition with scikit-learn](https://thedatafrog.com/en/articles/handwritten-digit-recognition-scikit-learn/)

Although we did not use a Convolutional Neural Network or Keras due to hardware constraints, these resources are also interesting.

- [Tuning a Deep Convolutional Network for Image Recognition, with keras and TensorFlow](https://thedatafrog.com/en/articles/deep-learning-keras/)
- [Convolutional Neural Networks tutorial â€“ Learn how machines interpret images](https://data-flair.training/blogs/convolutional-neural-networks-tutorial/)
